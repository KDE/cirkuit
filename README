Description
-----------
Cirkuit is a KDE4 interface for LaTeX graphic tools (such as TikZ, Gnuplot, Circuit Macros) to produce publication-ready pictures.

Cirkuit can also be used as a GUI for Circuit macros by Dwight Aplevich, which is a set of macros for drawing high-quality line diagrams to include in TeX, LaTeX, or similar documents. Cirkuit builds a live preview of the source code and can export the resulting images in various formats. Cirkuit supports also live preview of TikZ and Gnuplot sources.
